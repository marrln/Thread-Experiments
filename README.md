# Thread-Experiments
Small collection of C experiments that explore parallel programming concepts using Pthreads
and (where applicable) OpenMP. The exercises demonstrate thread creation, synchronization,
and simple performance measurements to compare approaches and illustrate speedup/scalability.

## How to run
Each experiment is self-contained in its directory (for example: `1_1_polynomial_multiplication`).
Run an experiment by changing into its directory and using the script provided there. Example:

```bash
cd 1_1_polynomial_multiplication
./run_poly_mult.sh
```

There is also a convenience script in the repository root to run all experiments in sequence:

```bash
./run_experiments.sh
```

Notes:
- On Windows, run the shell scripts from WSL, Git Bash, or another POSIX-like environment.
- The individual experiment scripts compile and append results to CSV files in each experiment
    folder (look for `results_*.csv`).

## Tagging runs with a user name (why this matters)
The experiment runner and plotting tools include a `user` field in the generated CSVs. The
plotting notebooks (for example `1_2_shared_variable_update/plotter_1_2.ipynb`) use that
`user` value to produce per-user plots and a combined `total` plot. To make your runs easy to
identify and compare, tag them with a user name.

How to provide a user tag:
- If a script supports a `--user` or `--name` argument, use that (check the script's header).
- Otherwise set the `USER` environment variable when invoking the runner. Examples:

Linux/macOS (bash):
```bash
USER=marr ./run_experiments.sh
```

Windows PowerShell (start a bash run with an env var):
```powershell
$env:USER = 'marr'; bash ./run_experiments.sh
```

If you run without specifying a name, the tools will typically mark rows as `unknown` or use
the local OS user name. Including an explicit `USER` value keeps CSVs and plots easier to
interpret when comparing multiple machines or runs.

## Per-experiment plots and results
- Per-experiment CSVs are located in each experiment folder (e.g. `1_2_shared_variable_update/results_1.2.csv`).
- Plots generated by notebooks are saved under `plots/` (for example `plots/1_2_<user>.png`).
