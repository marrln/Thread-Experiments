# Thread-Experiments
This repository contains a collection of projects exploring parallel programming concepts in C 
using both Pthreads and OpenMP. The experiments cover tasks such as polynomial multiplication, 
shared variable updates, array analysis, bank transaction simulations, and barrier synchronization. 
Each project demonstrates techniques for thread creation, synchronization, and performance evaluation 
in parallel systems, comparing different approaches and highlighting speedup and scalability.
